TODO

- turn off text decoration across all pages
- move stuff out of static so it isn't bundled separately from webpack build (ie webicons)

- turn gzip on server
- serve gzip'd files?

stop uploading big images over & over.. aren't they in the webpack bundle?


`npm audit` returns the following, but can't update because
